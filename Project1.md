#WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

I signed into my AWS free tier account and launched a new EC2 instance using a t2.micro on the Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. Within the instance i set my SG to SSH and i also set up HTTP on port 80. I created a new KP and saved in.

I then proceeded to SSH into my instance using MobaXterm client.
